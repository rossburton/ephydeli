What Is It?
==

EphyDeli is a small extension for Epiphany that adds a menu item and toolbar
button to post the current web site to Del.icio.us.  Simply press Tools->Post To
Del.icio.us or press the Del.icio.us icon on the toolbar to go to the post page
at Del.icio.us.

Installation
==

For now, simply copy the following files to ~/.gnome2/epiphany/extensions:

* deliciouspost.ephy-extension
* deliciouspost.py
* delicious.png

Then go to Tools->Extensions... and enable Post to Del.icio.us.  If you want a
toolbar icon too, edit the toolbar as usual.
